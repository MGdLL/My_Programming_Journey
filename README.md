Hi! My name is María,

Welcome to my Programming Learning Journey.

The purpose of this repository is to expand my Data Analysis and Data Scientist skills. 

To do so, I am currently learning and doing projects about these different languages:
- SQL
- Python

At the same time, I am working on small projects to expand my skills, especially related to AI:
- Script for extracting comments from social media.
- Automated AI tool for categorizing qualitative data

Check what I am up to! 👩‍💻
