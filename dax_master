-- INTRODUCTION TO DAX IN POWER BI

-- Table: x1, x2...
-- Column: y1, y2...
-- Row: z1, z2...

  
-- SUM() (adds all the numbers in a column)
SUM(y1)

-- LEFT() (returns the specified number of characters from the star of a text)
LEFT('texthere', 4) = "text"

-- ITERATIVE FUNCTION (they are a normal calculation followed by an X)(is like a normal calculation, average sum etc. 
but it allows to insert a previous calculation, so you don't have to create another column with that calculation) 
(ONLY FOR MEASURES)
SUMX(Sales, Sales[Price] + (Sales[Price] * Sales[Tax]));

-- FILTER (Expression: a measure or calculation to be evaluated. Must return a single value. 
Filters need to evaluate as a table) (FILTERS COLUMNS, NOT MEASURES)
CALCULATE(<expression>[, <filter1> [, <filter2> [, ...]]]);
CALCULATE(SUM(Sales), Sales[Region]="EMEA");

-- VAR (to assign a name to a calculation that allows to works with it later in the same formula more efficiently)
VAR name1 = CALCULATE (
  SUM (x[y1] ),
  FILTER ( x, x[y2] = 'text')
RETURNS DIVIDE (name1 / another calculation);

-- DATE AND TIME
YEAR(<date>)
QUARTER(<datetime>)
MONTH(<datetime>)

-- FORMAT (to change the format. there are a lot of options)
FORMAT(<date>,<"dddd">)

-- CALENDAR AUTO (returns a table with a single column 'date'that automatically takes the earliest
and latest date in the model and internally calls CALENDAR())
CALENDARAUTO (datecolumn)
