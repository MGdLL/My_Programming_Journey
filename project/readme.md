👋 Welcome

Hi! I am currently working on different projects to expand my knowledge, especially in data analysis and AI. These projects are a way to practice new skills, apply concepts I learn, and explore real-world use cases.

  🔎 What you will find here
  📖 A short definition of each project
  🎯 The main objectives 
  🛠️ The technologies used 
  💻 The code and implementation details

🚀 Goal

The aim of this repository is to document my learning journey while building small but useful projects related to data and artificial intelligence.
