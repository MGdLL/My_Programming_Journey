# you use "#" for writing annotations
# Remember, = in Python means assignment, it doesn't test equality!

# FUNCTIONS

  print() 
  #to launch the function inside the parenthesis
  
  type()
  # to know the type of variable (sting, boolean...).
  
  str(), int(), float(), bool(), list()
  # to transform the variable into a string, integer, float number or boolean.
  # For adding strings with integers, first you need to transform those integers in strings like:
    #print("I started with $" + str(savings) + " and now have $" + str(total_savings) + ". Awesome!")
    # Result: I started with $100 and now have $150. Awesome!


# LISTS & SUBLISTS
# you can enter whatever type of variable inside and mix them. You must use [] 
# Here is an example of a list with a sublist

fam=[[1.86, 'dad'], [1.67, 'mom']]

  # SUBSETTLING LISTS - to select a specific variable inside your list
  # The first value counts as 0, so if you want the 5th value you must put 4

  fam = [1.86, 'dad', 1.67, 'mom']
  fam2 = fam [2] ---> 1.67
  fam2 = fam [-3] ---> 'dad'

  # LIST SLICING - to select multiple values inside your list. They return all values between the positions you give them
  fam [start:end] 
  fam2 = fam [1:3] ---> 'dad', 1.67,'mom

  #LIST CALCULATIONS
  fam2=(fam[1]+fam[3]) ---> 'dadmom'
