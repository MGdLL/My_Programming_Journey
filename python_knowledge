# you use "#" for writing annotations
# Remember, = in Python means assignment, it doesn't test equality!

# FUNCTIONS

  print() 
  #to launch the function inside the parenthesis
  
  type()
  # to know the type of variable (sting, boolean...).
  
  str(), int(), float(), bool()
  # to transform the variable into a string, integer, float number or boolean.
  # For adding strings with integers, first you need to transform those integers in strings like:
    #print("I started with $" + str(savings) + " and now have $" + str(total_savings) + ". Awesome!")
    # Result: I started with $100 and now have $150. Awesome!
