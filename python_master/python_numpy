#NUMPY

#ARRAY - for calculating using numpy you first have to transform a list in a numpy array

import numpy as np
heigh_calculation = np.array(heigh)

heigh_multiply = heigh_calculation * 2


#2D NUMPY ARRAY - for selecting and making calculations with a list of lists

import numpy as np

baseball = [[180, 78.4],
            [215, 102.7],
            [210, 98.5],
            [188, 75.2]]

# Create a 2D numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball=np.array(baseball)

# Print out the type of np_baseball
print(type(np_baseball))

#For SELECTING elements for your 2D numpy array:
# numpy
import numpy as np
np_x = np.array(x)
np_x[:, 0]
The indexes before the commas indicates de rows, and after the comma the columns. ":" indicates that you want all rows

# Select the entire second column of np_baseball: np_weight_lb
np_weight_lb=np_baseball[:,1]

# Print out height of 124th player
print(np_baseball[123,0])
