--- JOINING DATA

-- INNER JOIN. LEFT (only shows the values of the left table that matches the values of the right, 
all the rest dissapears, including the ones from the left that does not match any of the right values) 
(x1 is the LEFT table, x2 the right)(y1 and y2 must be equivalent)(you can use USING instead of ON if 
the name of both columns are the same)
  
  SELECT y1, y2
  FROM X1 AS 1
  INNER JOIN X2 AS 2
  ON 1.y1 = 2.y3
  
  SELECT y1, y2
  FROM X1 AS 1
  INNER JOIN X2 AS 2
  USING (y1)
