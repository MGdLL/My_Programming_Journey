-- CASE (to create a new columna whose statement is: if something is x, then y)
  SELECT y,
  CASE  WHEN y = 1  AND y2>1 THEN 'a'      
        WHEN y = 2 AND y2>1 THEN 'b'     
        ELSE 'c' END AS new_column
  FROM x
  WHERE y2=2
  GROUP BY new_column;

  -- you can also enter CASE uses inside WHERE clause
  SELECT *
  FROM x
  WHERE 
      CASE WHEN y > 5 THEN 'Keep'
           WHEN y <= 5 THEN 'Exclude' END = 'z';
