--INTRODUCTION TO SQL
-- table = x
-- columns= y1, y2, y3
-- Remember in SQL you use simple quotes (')


--SELECT
SELECT * FROM x;
SELECT y1, y2 FROM x;

--SELECT DISTINCT
SELECT DISTINCT y1 FROM x;

--AS
SELECT y1 AS y FROM x;

--CREATE VIEW
CREATE VIEW x2 AS
SELECT y1, y2
FROM x;

--LIMIT (Postgre SQL)
SELECT * FROM x
LIMIT 6;



-- INTERMEDIATE SQL

--COUNT (count rows from an specific column)
SELECT COUNT(y1) AS Y1
FROM x

-- DISTINCT (returns all different values)
SELECT DISTINCT(y1) 
FROM x

-- COUNT DISTINCT (returns the count, a number, of all different values)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(y1))
FROM x

-- WHERE
SELECT y1
FROM x
WHERE y2 = 0

SELECT y1
FROM X
WHERE y2<>'text';

Operators:
> greater than or after
< smaller than or before
>=
<=
<> not equal to
= equal to

-- OR
SELECT y1
FROM x
WHERE y1=1 OR y2<>0;

-- AND
SELECT y1
FROM x
WHERE y1=1 AND y2<>0

SELECT y1
FROM x
WHERE (y1=1 OR y2<>0) AND (y3='red' OR y4<>'blue')

-- BETWEEN
SELECT y1
FROM x
WHERE y1 BETWEEN 1 AND 10

-- LIKE (to search, filter)
-- % (match zero, one or many characters)(tex% - text, texted, tex)
-- _ (match a single character)(tex% - text, texs)
SELECT y1
FROM X
WHERE y2 LIKE 'tex%';

SELECT y1
FROM X
WHERE y2 LIKE 'tex_';

-- NOT LIKE
SELECT y1
FROM X
WHERE y2 NOT LIKE '_ex%';

-- IN (instead of using a lot of OR you concatenate the values)
SELECT y1
FROM X
WHERE y2 IN (1,2,3)
